Very WIP

§§§---- How to use ----§§§
- Adds a minimap icon. Left click to enable/disable display output, Right click to configure.
- Navigate to your TMB guild page and locate the export button within the admin dropdown
- View CSV of "Loot Received, Wishlists, Prios, and Notes" copy the raw text and paste in the textfield of the config window. Click parse.

This needs to be done whenever you make a change on TMB website.
